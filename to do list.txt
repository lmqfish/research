Kitaev
1. cyrstal field splitting. when eg lower than t2g?
Tetrahedral, eg closer
An electron in the dyz orbital can approach the ligand to within a distance of a/2, where a is the cube edge length. However, an electron in dz2 only approaches the ligands at a distance of a/2(20.5), a distance 1.414 times as long as the distance in the dyz case. This means that the dz2 orbital is lower in energy than the dyz orbital, exactly the z2 gy yz opposite case as in octahedral coordination.
