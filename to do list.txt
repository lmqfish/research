Kitaev
1. cyrstal field splitting. when eg lower than t2g?
2. summarize eletronic correlation, spin-orbit coupling, hund's interaction
	3d, 4d, 5d: U decreases from 4ev to 2ev to 1ev. lambda increases from 2meV(or 20meV) to 500meV
	U1=U2+2Jh
3. derive the SOC for t2g
4. read yuriy paper, derive why j=1/2 cancel out


Spinwave
1. read spinwave paper
2. rewrite spinwave appendix
3. explain why direction matters


Topology
1. what is Z2 vortex
2. why z2 vortex is different than others


Model
1. organize codes
2. get w and intensity for d=3k


Talk
1. summarize kitaev interaction in one slide
2. prepare for Tuesday talk
3. print results in nice figures
